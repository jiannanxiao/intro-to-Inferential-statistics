### The kinds of numerial data

**Ratio data**（比例值）: ranks with equal intervals and an absolute zero.

e.g. percentage correct on a test.



**Ordinal data**（序数值）: ranks

e.g.finishing order in a race.



**Interval data**（间隔值）: ranks with equal intervals.

e.g.ranks with  equal intevals

### Chi-square test（卡方检验）



**Chi-square test can be used to check how well observed values fit the expected values for categorical data.**


$$
\chi^2=\sum\frac{(f_o-f_e)^2}{f_e}
$$
Chi-squared is smaller when expected values are closer to observed values.



Chi-squared value is always positive; it's always **one-direction** test.



The more categories, the more likely we'll get a large chi-squared value. (and it gets close to a normal distribution)



**Degree of freedom = number of categories - 1**



### Cramer's V

**Cramér's V** (sometimes referred to as **Cramér's phi** and denoted as **φc**) is a measure of association between two nominal variables, giving a value between 0 and +1 (inclusive). 
$$
Cramer's V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n(k-1)}}
$$
*k is the smaller number of rows or columns 



### Assumptions and restroctions for chi-square tests

1. avoid dependent observations
2. avoid small expected frequencies
